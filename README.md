# centipede-remake
A rebuild of the arcade game, Centipede, from scratch using robust C++ code.

****Navigate to centipede-remake/project/kburnett/CentipedeRemake_vFinal/MyCentipede/MyCentipede to see the code I wrote for the game.

*The remake utilizes SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) and TEAL (Professor Andre Berthiaume's 2D game engine from DePaul University).
